# Non-Interactive Verification Protocol (v2)

## Purpose

After the agent builds or modifies code, verify correctness without asking the user. Each skill has a verification protocol using static analysis, compilation, simulation, and on-chain queries. The agent runs only the protocols for skills this project uses.

## Architecture (v2 Changes)

### Just-In-Time Loading

Same as v1: load protocols only for loaded skills. 5 skills = 5 protocols.

### Execution Tiers

Each check is tagged by what it needs to run:

| Tier | Needs | Run When | Examples |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| **T1: Static** | Source code only | After every code change | grep, tsc, forge build, ESLint |
| **T2: Simulated** | Chain RPC (eth_call) | After compilation passes | forge script --fork-url, cast call |
| **T3: Deployed** | Contract on-chain | After deployment | cast code, cast call against deployed address |
| **T4: Runtime** | Server running | After server startup | curl health endpoint, Playwright |

Run T1 always. Run T2 only if RPC is available. Run T3 only after deployment. Run T4 only after startup. Never report a T3 failure when the contract hasn't been deployed yet.

### Check Dependencies

Within each protocol, checks are either **blocking** (later checks depend on it) or **independent** (can run in parallel after prerequisites pass).

```
BLOCKING:    Check 1 → Check 2 → [Check 3, Check 4, Check 5] independent
                                         ↓
                              Report ALL failures at once
```

If a blocking check fails, skip its dependents. If an independent check fails, still run the other independent checks and report all failures together. This prevents the "fix one, discover another, fix that, discover a third" loop.

### Confidence Levels

| Level | Meaning | Agent Behavior |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **HIGH** | Binary pass/fail, no false positives (compiler, runtime) | Treat failure as definitive |
| **MEDIUM** | Pattern match, possible false positives (grep-based structural checks) | Flag as "likely issue — verify manually if uncertain" |
| **LOW** | Heuristic, often matches non-issues (keyword scanning) | Flag as "possible concern" — never block on it |

### Automated Fixes

For checks with deterministic fixes, the protocol specifies the exact transformation. The agent applies the fix and re-runs the check without asking.

## Per-Skill Protocols

### CONTRACTS

**Blocking checks (sequential):**

| # | Check | Tier | Confidence | Command | Auto-Fix |
|---|-------|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Compilation | T1 | HIGH | `forge build 2>&1` | Fix compiler errors |
| 2 | via_ir for large ABIs | T1 | HIGH | `grep -q 'via_ir.*=.*true' foundry.toml` | Insert `via_ir = true` under `[profile.default]` in foundry.toml |

**Independent checks (parallel after blocking pass):**

| # | Check | Tier | Confidence | Command | Auto-Fix |
|---|-------|------|-----------|---------|----------|

| 4 | Precompile addresses | T1 | MEDIUM | Extract all `address(0x08...)` values, compare against canonical: HTTP=0x0801, LLM=0x0802, Sovereign Agent=0x080C, Image=0x0818, Audio=0x0819, Video=0x081A, LongHTTP=0x0805, ZK=0x0806, Persistent=0x0820, DKMS=0x081B | Replace with canonical address |
| 5 | ABI + DA field shape (if LLM/multimodal/agents) | T1 | MEDIUM | Count `abi.encode` parameters in LLM precompile call — must be 30 (5 base + 25 LLM including convoHistory). For DA fields, verify StorageRef tuple `(string,string,string)` and reject stale patterns like `storageType` / `encryptedStoragePayment`. | Consult `ritual-dapp-precompiles` and `ritual-dapp-da` |

| 8 | frontend + backend | API base URL in frontend matches backend server port/host | T1 | MEDIUM |

---

## Regression Protocol

After any code modification during a fix:

1. **Always re-run T1 (static) checks** for ALL loaded skills — not just the modified skill. This catches cross-skill regressions from simple edits. T1 checks are cheap (grep + compile).
2. **Re-run T2+ checks** only for the skill whose code was modified.
3. **Re-run cross-skill integration checks** if the modification touches a shared interface (addresses, selectors, status names, ABI encoding).

---

## Unified End-to-End Verification — User Journey Emulation

The per-skill and cross-skill checks verify components in isolation and at interfaces. This section verifies the **complete user journey** from start to finish — emulating exactly what a real user would do, in order, with each step gated on the previous step's success. If this passes, the application works. Period.

This is the strong-typing equivalent for the full stack: every state transition is verified, every data flow is traced end-to-end, and no step is skipped. The individual skill checks are unit tests. The cross-skill checks are interface tests. This is the integration test.

### Preconditions

The unified protocol runs AFTER all per-skill checks and cross-skill checks pass. It requires:
- T3 tier: contracts deployed on-chain
- T4 tier: frontend and backend (if applicable) running
- A funded test EOA with RitualWallet deposit

If any precondition is not met, the unified protocol CANNOT run. Report which precondition is missing and skip.

### The Journey

The protocol emulates 12 steps a real user takes. Each step has an **assertion** — a concrete, verifiable condition that must be true before proceeding. If any assertion fails, the journey stops and the failure is reported with the exact step, expected outcome, and actual outcome.

```
Step 1 ──assert──► Step 2 ──assert──► Step 3 ──assert──► ... ──assert──► Step 12
   │                  │                  │                                   │
   FAIL               FAIL               FAIL                               PASS
   ↓                  ↓                  ↓                                   ↓
   Report             Report             Report                          "Journey verified"
```

---

#### Step 1: Chain Reachable

**Action:** Query the RPC endpoint.
**Assert:** `cast block-number --rpc-url $RITUAL_RPC_URL` returns a positive integer.
**Assert:** `cast chain-id --rpc-url $RITUAL_RPC_URL` returns `1979`.
**Fail means:** Wrong RPC URL, network unreachable, or wrong chain. Nothing else will work.

```bash
BLOCK=$(cast block-number --rpc-url $RITUAL_RPC_URL 2>/dev/null)
CHAIN=$(cast chain-id --rpc-url $RITUAL_RPC_URL 2>/dev/null)
[ -n "$BLOCK" ] && [ "$CHAIN" = "1979" ] || exit 1
```

---

#### Step 2: Wallet Funded

**Action:** Check the test EOA's native RITUAL balance and RitualWallet deposit.
**Assert:** Native balance > 0 (can pay gas).
**Assert:** `RitualWallet.balanceOf(testEOA)` > 0 (can pay executor fees).
**Assert:** `RitualWallet.lockUntil(testEOA)` > current block + 5000 (lock covers operations).
**Fail means:** The user can't submit any async transaction. Must deposit first.

```bash
NATIVE_BAL=$(cast balance $TEST_EOA --rpc-url $RITUAL_RPC_URL)
WALLET_BAL=$(cast call $RITUAL_WALLET "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" $TEST_EOA --rpc-url $RITUAL_RPC_URL)
LOCK_UNTIL=$(cast call $RITUAL_WALLET "lockUntil(address)(uint256)" $TEST_EOA --rpc-url $RITUAL_RPC_URL)
CURRENT_BLOCK=$(cast block-number --rpc-url $RITUAL_RPC_URL)
[ "$NATIVE_BAL" != "0" ] && [ "$WALLET_BAL" != "0" ] && [ "$LOCK_UNTIL" -gt "$((CURRENT_BLOCK + 5000))" ] || exit 2
```

---

#### Step 3: Executor Available

**Action:** Query TEEServiceRegistry for the capability the dApp uses.
**Assert:** At least one executor returned with `isValid=true`.
**Fail means:** No executor can process the request. The transaction will submit but never settle.

```bash
CAPABILITY=0  # 0=HTTP, 1=LLM, 7=Image, etc. — set based on project
EXECUTORS=$(cast call $TEE_REGISTRY "getServicesByCapability(uint8,bool)" $CAPABILITY true --rpc-url $RITUAL_RPC_URL)
[ -n "$EXECUTORS" ] && [ "$EXECUTORS" != "0x" ] || exit 3
```

---

#### Step 4: Consumer Contract Deployed and Callable

**Action:** Verify the dApp's consumer contract has bytecode and its key functions are callable via `eth_call`.
**Assert:** `cast code $CONTRACT_ADDRESS` returns non-empty bytecode.
**Assert:** A view function on the contract returns without revert (e.g., `owner()`, `results(bytes32)`, or any read function).
**Fail means:** Contract not deployed, wrong address, or constructor reverted.

```bash
CODE=$(cast code $CONTRACT_ADDRESS --rpc-url $RITUAL_RPC_URL)
[ "$CODE" != "0x" ] || exit 4
# Call a view function to verify the contract is functional
cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "owner()(address)" --rpc-url $RITUAL_RPC_URL 2>/dev/null || exit 4
```

---

#### Step 5: Sender Not Locked

**Action:** Check that the test EOA does NOT have a pending async job.
**Assert:** `AsyncJobTracker.hasPendingJobForSender(testEOA)` returns `false`.
**Fail means:** A previous test or operation left a pending job. Wait for settlement or use a different EOA.

```bash
IS_LOCKED=$(cast call $ASYNC_JOB_TRACKER "hasPendingJobForSender(address)(bool)" $TEST_EOA --rpc-url $RITUAL_RPC_URL)
[ "$IS_LOCKED" = "false" ] || exit 5
```

---

#### Step 6: Precompile Call Simulates Successfully

**Action:** Encode the precompile request (using the exact parameters the dApp would use) and run `eth_call` against the precompile address.
**Assert for short-running async precompiles (HTTP, LLM):** `eth_call` returns non-empty data (the simulation envelope). Note: `actualOutput` may be `0x` in simulation — this is expected. The simulation envelope itself being non-empty is the pass condition.
**Assert for long-running async precompiles (Sovereign Agent, Image):** `eth_call` returns non-empty data.
**Assert for synchronous precompiles (ONNX, JQ, SECP256R1):** `eth_call` returns the actual result.
**Fail means:** ABI encoding is wrong, precompile address is wrong, or executor address is invalid.

```bash
ENCODED=$(cast abi-encode "f(...)" $PARAMS)  # project-specific encoding
RESULT=$(cast call $PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS $ENCODED --rpc-url $RITUAL_RPC_URL 2>/dev/null)
[ -n "$RESULT" ] && [ "$RESULT" != "0x" ] || exit 6
```

---

#### Step 7: Transaction Submits and Mines

**Action:** Submit the actual precompile call (or consumer contract call) as a real transaction with the test EOA.
**Assert:** `cast send` returns a transaction hash.
**Assert:** `cast receipt $TX_HASH` returns a receipt with `status: 1` (success).
**Assert for short-running async:** The receipt contains `spcCalls` field with at least one entry.
**Assert for long-running async:** The receipt is status 1 (Phase 1 mined). The result arrives later via callback.
**Fail means:** Insufficient gas, encoding error, contract revert, executor rejection, or insufficient RitualWallet deposit.

```bash
TX_HASH=$(cast send $TARGET $ENCODED --rpc-url $RITUAL_RPC_URL --private-key $TEST_PRIVATE_KEY --gas-limit 3000000)
RECEIPT_STATUS=$(cast receipt $TX_HASH --rpc-url $RITUAL_RPC_URL | grep "status" | awk '{print $2}')
[ "$RECEIPT_STATUS" = "1" ] || exit 7

# For short-running async precompiles: verify spcCalls present
# (Requires custom RPC call or viem script since cast doesn't expose spcCalls)
```

---

#### Step 8: Result Delivered (short-running async) or Callback Fires (long-running async)

**For short-running async precompiles (HTTP, LLM, DKMS):**
**Action:** Extract `spcCalls[0].output` from the transaction receipt.
**Assert:** Output is non-empty hex.
**Assert:** Decoded output matches the expected schema (e.g., HTTP: uint16 + string[] + string[] + bytes + string).

**For long-running async precompiles (Sovereign Agent, Image, Long HTTP):**
**Action:** Poll `AsyncJobTracker.isPhase1Settled(jobId)` until it returns `true`, or check that current block exceeds `commitBlock + ttl`. Then watch for your consumer contract's callback event (e.g., `SovereignAgentResultDelivered`, `LongRunningResultReceived`).
**Assert:** Phase 1 settles within TTL. Callback fires after Phase 2 delivery.
**Assert:** The consumer contract's callback was invoked (check for emitted events).

```bash
# For long-running async: poll Phase 1 settlement
for i in $(seq 1 60); do
  P1=$(cast call $ASYNC_JOB_TRACKER "isPhase1Settled(bytes32)(bool)" $JOB_ID --rpc-url $RITUAL_RPC_URL)
  [ "$P1" = "true" ] && break
  sleep 5
done
[ "$P1" = "true" ] || exit 8
# Then watch for your consumer contract's result event for Phase 2
```

#### Step 9: Result Decodable and Semantically Valid

**Action:** Decode the result using the precompile-specific ABI.
**Assert for HTTP:** `statusCode` is in range 100-599. `errorMessage` is empty (or matches expected API error).
**Assert for LLM:** `hasError` is false. `completionData` parses as valid JSON with `choices[0].message.content` non-empty.
**Assert for Sovereign Agent:** `success` is true. `response` is non-empty. `stoppedReason` is "completed" or "max_iterations."
**Assert for Image/Audio/Video:** `outputUri` is a valid URL. `outputContentHash` is non-zero.
**Fail means:** Executor returned corrupt or unexpected data. ABI mismatch between encoding and decoding.

```bash
# Decode and validate (project-specific)
# For HTTP:
STATUS_CODE=$(... decode uint16 from output ...)
[ "$STATUS_CODE" -ge 100 ] && [ "$STATUS_CODE" -lt 600 ] || exit 9

# For LLM:
HAS_ERROR=$(... decode bool from output ...)
[ "$HAS_ERROR" = "false" ] || exit 9
```

#### Step 10: Consumer Contract State Updated

**Action:** Read the consumer contract's state to verify the result was persisted.
**Assert:** If the contract stores results (e.g., `results[jobId]`), the stored value is non-empty.
**Assert:** If the contract emits events, the expected event was emitted in the settlement transaction.
**Fail means:** Callback didn't fire (wrong selector, wrong deliveryTarget, insufficient delivery gas), or callback reverted silently.

```bash
STORED_RESULT=$(cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "getResult(bytes32)(string)" $JOB_ID --rpc-url $RITUAL_RPC_URL)
[ -n "$STORED_RESULT" ] || exit 10
```

---

#### Step 11: Frontend Renders Result (if frontend exists)

**Action:** Using Playwright (or equivalent), load the dApp in a browser, connect the test wallet, and verify the result is displayed.
**Assert:** The page loads without console errors.
**Assert:** The wallet connects and shows the correct address.
**Assert:** The result from Step 9 appears in the UI (match text content, or verify a result container is non-empty).
**Assert:** The async status indicator shows SETTLED (not stuck on PENDING or PROCESSING).
**Fail means:** Frontend is not connected to the correct contract, spcCalls parsing is broken, state machine didn't transition, or rendering error.

```typescript
// Playwright test (conceptual)
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('E2E: result renders after settlement', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(process.env.APP_URL || 'http://127.0.0.1:3000');

  // Wallet should connect (via test fixture or mock)
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="wallet-address"]')).toContainText(TEST_EOA.slice(0, 6));

  // Result should be visible
  const resultContainer = page.locator('[data-testid="result"]');
  await expect(resultContainer).not.toBeEmpty({ timeout: 120_000 });

  // Status should be SETTLED
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="status"]')).toContainText('Settled');

  // No console errors
  const errors: string[] = [];
  page.on('console', msg => { if (msg.type() === 'error') errors.push(msg.text()); });
  expect(errors).toHaveLength(0);
});
```

---

#### Step 12: Backend Indexed (if backend exists)

**Action:** Query the backend API for the job that was just submitted.
**Assert:** `GET /api/jobs/:jobId` returns 200 with status `SETTLED`.
**Assert:** The `result` field is non-null and matches the decoded result from Step 9.
**Assert:** The backend health endpoint shows `indexerLag < 500` blocks.
**Fail means:** Backend event watcher missed the event, database write failed, or indexer is lagging.

```bash
API_BASE="${API_BASE:-http://127.0.0.1:3001}"
JOB_RESPONSE=$(curl -sf "$API_BASE/api/jobs/$JOB_ID")
STATUS=$(echo $JOB_RESPONSE | jq -r '.status')
RESULT=$(echo $JOB_RESPONSE | jq -r '.result')
[ "$STATUS" = "SETTLED" ] && [ "$RESULT" != "null" ] || exit 12

HEALTH=$(curl -sf "$API_BASE/api/health" | jq -r '.indexerLag.blocks')
[ "$HEALTH" -lt 500 ] || echo "WARN: Indexer lag is $HEALTH blocks"
```

### Journey Invariants

These conditions must hold at EVERY step, not just at the end:

| Invariant | Checked At | What It Means |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Chain ID = 1979 | Steps 1, 6, 7 | Every RPC call targets the correct chain |
| Sender not locked | Steps 5, 7 | Only one async job per EOA at a time |
| All addresses checksum-valid | Steps 4, 6, 7, 10 | No truncated or malformed addresses |
| Gas limit explicit (never estimated for async) | Step 7 | Async precompile gas estimation fails — always set explicitly |
| Receipt status = 1 | Steps 7, 8 | No silent reverts |
| spcCalls accessed for short-running async precompiles | Steps 8, 9 | Result is in the receipt extension, not in logs |
| Callback auth = AsyncDelivery | Step 10 | Only the system can invoke callbacks |

### Failure Diagnosis

When a step fails, the unified protocol produces a structured failure report:

```
UNIFIED VERIFICATION FAILED

Step:     [N] — [Step Name]
Expected: [What should have happened]
Actual:   [What actually happened]
TX Hash:  [If applicable]

Likely root cause:
  If Step 1-2 failed:  Infrastructure (RPC, funding)
  If Step 3 failed:    Executor availability
  If Step 4-5 failed:  Deployment or sender lock
  If Step 6 failed:    ABI encoding or address mismatch
  If Step 7 failed:    Transaction-level error (gas, revert, deposit)
  If Step 8-9 failed:  Executor processing or result decoding
  If Step 10 failed:   Callback configuration (selector, gas, auth)
  If Step 11 failed:   Frontend rendering or state machine
  If Step 12 failed:   Backend indexing or API

Next action: Run the per-skill verification protocol for the implicated skill.
```

### The Strong-Typing Guarantee

If all 12 steps pass:

- The chain is reachable and correct (Step 1)
- The user can pay for operations (Step 2)
- An executor exists to process the request (Step 3)
- The contract is deployed and functional (Step 4)
- No sender lock blocks the submission (Step 5)
- The precompile encoding is correct (Step 6)
- The transaction submits and mines successfully (Step 7)
- The result is delivered (Step 8)
- The result is decodable and semantically valid (Step 9)
- The on-chain state reflects the result (Step 10)
- The user can see the result in the browser (Step 11)
- The backend has indexed the result (Step 12)

**There are no gaps.** Every data flow — from user wallet to chain to executor to receipt to contract state to frontend display to backend index — has been verified. The application works end-to-end. The probability of a user encountering a failure that this protocol did not catch is bounded by: (a) non-deterministic executor behavior, or (b) race conditions in high-throughput block production (use `ritual-dapp-block-time` to estimate current block cadence on your target deployment).

## Running the Full Protocol

```
1. Determine which skills are loaded for this project.
2. For each loaded skill, run BLOCKING checks in order.
     If a blocking check fails → fix (auto-fix if available) → re-run.
3. Run all INDEPENDENT checks in parallel.
     Collect ALL failures at once.
4. Fix all independent failures. Re-run failed checks.
5. Run cross-skill integration checks (if multiple skills loaded).
6. On any fix: run regression protocol (T1 for all skills).
7. Run unified E2E journey verification (Steps 1-12, skip steps for missing components).
     If Step 11 requires Playwright and it's not configured: skip, note as unverified.
     If Step 12 requires a backend and there is none: skip.
8. Report to user only if there were failures that required non-trivial fixes.
   Silent on all-pass. On unified journey pass: "End-to-end verified."
```
